# ALU_design

*Introduction:* <br>
ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations. It is also one of the most fundamental units of many computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, and the graphic processing unit (GPU) of video cards.
In this project, you can find independent modules that can perform 8-bit arithmetic operations like ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION and logic operations like AND, OR, XOR, NOT and bitwise operations like SHIFT RIGHT, SHIFT LEFT. In the end all combine to form an ALU.

Inputs of an ALU are primarily the operands which are the data to be operated on. In addition, an ALU has opcodes (operation codes) as inputs to control the type of operation the ALU shall perform.
